Etch-A-Sketch Web Edition
Overview:
The Etch-A-Sketch Web Edition is an engaging browser application designed to hone DOM manipulation skills. It blends the functionality of a sketchpad with the nostalgic essence of the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy. Unlike the typical static webpage, the components of this project are primarily generated and manipulated using JavaScript, offering a dynamic user experience.

Features:

Dynamic Grid Creation: A grid made up of 16x16 square divs is generated on the webpage. This grid is constructed dynamically using JavaScript, ensuring the versatility and scalability of the platform.

Responsive Grid System: The grid squares are neatly arranged within a container div, utilizing the power of flexbox to ensure they are uniformly aligned, irrespective of the screen size.

Interactive Coloring: The project offers an interactive coloring system. As users hover their mouse over the grid, the squares light up, leaving a pixelated trail, reminiscent of drawing on a sketchpad.

Customizable Grid Size: A dedicated button allows users to determine the size of their sketchpad. On pressing this button, users are prompted to specify the number of squares per side for their grid. The app then dynamically adjusts, regenerates the grid, and preserves the overall dimensions of the sketchpad.

Advanced Coloring Options

Random RGB Coloring: Each time a grid square is hovered over, its color morphs into a randomized RGB value, providing a vibrant and unpredictable coloring experience.
Progressive Darkening: The grid squares don’t just change color – they progressively darken with each interaction. After ten hovers, a square achieves complete darkness, adding depth and variation to users' creations.
Challenges:
Throughout the development process, frequent online research was imperative to uncover the right JavaScript methods and CSS techniques. The project served as a valuable exercise in debugging, with tools like the browser’s developer console and strategic console.log statements ensuring smooth execution.

Conclusion:
Embarking on the journey of creating the Etch-A-Sketch Web Edition was both challenging and exhilarating. As an aspiring developer, every hurdle faced was an opportunity to learn
